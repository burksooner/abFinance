    Computes the nearest valid correlation matrix to a given symmetric matrix.

    This method is known as Higham's Nearest Correlation Matrix Algorithm. It was introduced by
    Nicholas J. Higham in the paper:
        Higham, N. J. (2002).
        "Computing the nearest correlation matrixâ€”A problem from finance."
        IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis, 22(3), 329-343.

    The algorithm is an iterative projection method that alternates between projecting a given
    matrix onto the space of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices and enforcing the unit
    diagonal constraint. The approach is widely used in finance and risk management when working
    with empirical correlation matrices that may not be numerically valid due to noise
    or rounding errors.

    Parameters:
        A (ndarray): Input symmetric matrix.
        tol (float): Convergence tolerance.
        max_iterations (int): Maximum number of iterations.

    Returns:
        ndarray: The nearest valid correlation matrix.
