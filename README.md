# abFinance

A comprehensive Python library for financial analysis, quantitative trading, and portfolio management. This library provides tools for calculating various financial metrics, analyzing market data, and implementing trading strategies.

> **Note:** This project is in early stages of development and serves as a growing collection of financial analysis scripts and workflows. Features are being actively developed and added over time.

## Current Status

This project is under active development. Here's the current status of features:

ðŸš§ **In Development:**
- Basic data structures and utilities
- Core financial calculations
- Data integration foundations

ðŸ“… **Planned Features:**
- Performance Metrics (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Omega ratio)
- Risk Analysis (VaR, Expected Shortfall, Beta calculation)
- Portfolio Management (optimization, risk allocation)
- Technical Analysis (Moving averages, momentum indicators)
- Advanced trading strategies

âœ¨ **Future Enhancements:**
- Integration with additional financial data providers
- Web dashboard for real-time analytics
- Machine learning models for market prediction
- Automated trading system integration
- Enhanced documentation and examples

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/abFinance.git
   cd abFinance
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Quick Start

As this project is in early development, the API is subject to change. Here's a basic example of intended usage:

```python
from abFinance.analysis import performance, risk
import pandas as pd

# Calculate Sharpe Ratio
returns = pd.Series([0.01, -0.02, 0.03, -0.01, 0.02])
sharpe = performance.calculate_sharpe_ratio(returns)

# Calculate Value at Risk
var = risk.calculate_var(returns, confidence_level=0.95)
```

## Documentation

Documentation is being developed alongside the codebase. Check the `docs/` directory for current documentation and examples.

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
